<Note>

Using custom redaction for Session Replay can expose sensitive data. Make sure to double-check every part of your app's data that you choose to redact or not.

</Note>

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data will leave the device. However, you can choose which parts of your app's data to redact or not by using some different options.


## Redact by View class

You can choose which type of view you want to redact or ignore by using the `redactViewClasses` or `ignoreViewClasses` options.

Let's say you have a custom view that you want to redact and a UILabel subclass (which normally would be redacted) that you want to ignore. You can set the options like this:

```swift
  options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactViewClasses = [MyCustomView.self]
  options.experimental.sessionReplay.ignoreViewClasses = [MyCustomLabel.self]
```

## Redact View by instance

You can also choose to redact or ignore a specific view instance by using the replay API or view extensions like this:

```swift
  SentrySDK.replay.redactView(view: view)
  SentrySDK.replay.ignoreView(view: label)
```
or

```swift
  view.sentryReplayRedact()
  label.sentryReplayIgnore()
```

## SwiftUI

Because of the way SwiftUI is transformed into UIKit, it will be often over-redacted. Modifier like `background` use the same element as an `Image`.
In order to be able to control SwiftUI redact process, first you need to disable the default redaction options:

```swift
    options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactAllText = false
    options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactAllImages = false
```

Then you can manually choose which `View` you want to redact with the `replayRedact` modifier

```swift    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .sentryReplayRedact()
    }
```

<Note>
Dissabling the default redaction options will expose all text and images in the session replay. 
Make sure to redact them manually.
