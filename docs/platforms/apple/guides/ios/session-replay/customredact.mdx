<Alert>

If you custom redact your Session Replays, you may accidentally expose sensitive customer data. Be sure to double-check what you choose to expose.

</Alert>

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input. This helps ensure that no sensitive data will be exposed. You can also manually choose which parts of your app's data to redact by using the different options listed below.


## Redact by View Class

You can choose which type of view you want to redact or ignore by using the `redactViewClasses` or `ignoreViewClasses` options.

Let's say you have a custom view that you want to redact and a `UILabel` subclass (which normally would be redacted) that you want to ignore. You can set the options like this:

```swift
  options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactViewClasses = [MyCustomView.self]
  options.experimental.sessionReplay.ignoreViewClasses = [MyCustomLabel.self]
```

## Redact by View Instance

You can also choose to redact or ignore a specific view instance by using the [replay API](/api/replays/) or view extensions like this:

```swift
  SentrySDK.replay.redactView(view: view)
  SentrySDK.replay.ignoreView(view: label)
```
or

```swift
  view.sentryReplayRedact()
  label.sentryReplayIgnore()
```

## SwiftUI

Because of the way SwiftUI is transformed into UIKit, it will often be over-redacted. A modifier like `background` uses the same element as an `Image`.
In order to control the SwiftUI redact process, you first need to disable the default redaction options:

```swift
    options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactAllText = false
    options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactAllImages = false
```

Then you can manually choose which `View` you want to redact with the `replayRedact` modifier:

```swift    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .sentryReplayRedact()
    }
```

<Note>
Disabling the default redaction options will expose all text and images in the session replay. 
Make sure to redact them manually.
